##Merge_Lists

The merge_lists.ipynb file contains a code that takes three lists as input, and merges the first two, removes the third, and returns a list:

- List shall only contain unique values
- List shall be ordered as follows:
--- Most character count to least character count
--- In the event of a tie, reverse alphabetical

This repository is made for a job application assignment.
